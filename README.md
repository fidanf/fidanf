### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Frank

I'm a 30 y/o french DevOps engineer whom first began working as a fullstack software developer. 

Most of my GitHub activity occurs on private repos but I like to either contribute or develop new projects whenever I can find enough free time.

Currently I'm mostly spending my time on topics including Ansible automation, CI/CD, containers orchestration, postgresql, linux, and ISO 27001 certification.
